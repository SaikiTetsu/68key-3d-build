## STL Files

Here is the [Custom 3D Print Files](https://www.printables.com/model/307908-mechanical-keyboard-68-key-65/).

## Software Needed

Additional software might be needed once IDE's are installed, but I was able to successfully build mine using the following:
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)
- [Adafruit ItsyBitsy](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4888/)

## Design Your Layout

Use the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) to design a custom layout for your 3D printed keyboard.

## Build Your Firmware

Create a custom firmware file for your keyboard with the [Keyboard Firmware Builder](https://kbfirmware.com/).

## Test Your Keyboard

Ensure everything works correctly when pressed using the [Keyboard Tester](https://www.keyboardtester.com/).
