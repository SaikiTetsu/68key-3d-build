**Introduction** --
This is a 3D printed keyboard that is fully customizable and easy to assemble. It is perfect for both beginners and experienced keyboard enthusiasts.

## Steps: <br>
**Features**
* Programmable QMK firmware
* Custom keyboard switches
* Wide range of customization options
* Easy assembly

**Getting Started**
1. Download and print the 3D print files.
2. Gather the required materials and tools.
3. Assemble/solder the keyboard according to the step-by-step instructions.
4. Install the keycaps and switches.
5. Connect the keyboard to your computer, install the firmware, and enjoy!

**Required Materials and Tools**
* 3D printed keyboard case (68%)
* Tinned stranded copper gauge wire (24 gauge silicone wire, get 10+ colors)
* Keycaps (Your choice)
* USB-C cable
* Screwdriver
* Soldering iron (optional)
* Fume extractors
* 1 - Teensy 2.0 (I used an Adafruit ItsyBitsy RP2040 Product ID: 4888)
* 68 - 1N4148 diodes
* 68 - of your favorite mechanical Keyboard switches (I used Redragon A113 Bullet-R linear 3-pin red)
* 3 - 2unit plate mount stabilizers
* 1 - 6.25 plate mount stabilizer for the spacebar
* 1 - USB-C breakout board
* 8 - 12mm M3 bolts
* 8 - 20mm M3 bolts
* 16 - M3 nuts

## STL Files
Here is the STL for the keyboard casing including the other parts. <br>
Download: [Custom 3D Print Files](https://www.printables.com/model/307908-mechanical-keyboard-68-key-65/).

## Software Needed
Addiontal software might be needed once IDE's are installed but I was able to successfully build mine using the following: <br>
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
* [Adafruit itsybitsy](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4888/).

## Keyboard Layout Editor
This is a link to the Keyboard Layout Editor: [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/), which is a web application that allows you to design and edit keyboard layouts.
You can use the Keyboard Layout Editor to design a custom keyboard layout for your 3D printed keyboard. Once you are happy with your layout, you can export it to a file that can be used to generate the 3D print files for your keyboard.

## Keyboard Firmware Builder
You can use the Keyboard Firmware Builder to create a custom firmware file for your keyboard. This firmware file will tell your keyboard how to behave, such as which keycodes to send when you press certain keys.
To create a custom firmware file, go to the [Keyboard Firmware Builder](https://kbfirmware.com/).

## Keyboard Tester
To test all the keys and make sure everything works correctly when pressed, go to [Keyboard Tester](https://www.keyboardtester.com/).

**Troubleshooting**
If you encounter any problems when assembling or using your keyboard, please consult the troubleshooting guide in the repo.
